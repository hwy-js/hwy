# TO DO

- Just make a public folder if one doesn't exist as part of build step
- Skip anything with critical bundled CSS, etc. in build step if you aren't
  actually using CSS
- Maybe need an "is_using_public_folder" and "is_using_styles_folder" state for
  build step
- Add ability to customize entry points
