# üõ£Ô∏è Hwy

Hwy is a simple, lightweight, and flexible web framework.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-hwy@latest
```

## What is Hwy?

At its core, Hwy is a server-rendered, multi-page app framework for NodeJS. Hwy is built on top of <a href="https://h3.unjs.io" target="_blank">h3</a> (the core server framework behind Nuxt and SolidStart), esbuild (for TypeScript transpilation and bundling), and React (for rendering JSX on the server, and optionally on the client).

If you want to upgrade beyond an MPA pattern, Hwy has first-class support for both React and HTMX on the client. This means you can build a full-featured SPA with Hwy, or you can build a traditional MPA, or you can build something in between.

## Features

- Server-rendered JSX
- Nested, file-based routing
- Remix-style actions and parallel loaders
- 100% type-safe
- Server built on h3
- MPA default, easily upgrade to client-side React or HTMX
- Built-in critical CSS inlining
- Live browser refresh during development
- And more...

## Guiding Principles

- No speed limits
- Numerous off-ramps
- Smooth, safe roads
- Clear traffic signs

## Simple usage

Below is an example of a simple Hwy page. You'll notice it looks a lot like Remix, and you're right!

```tsx
// src/pages/user/$user_id.page.tsx

import type { DataProps, PageProps } from "hwy";
import { UserProfile, getUser } from "./somewhere.js";

export async function loader({ params }: DataProps) {
  return await getUser(params.user_id);
}

export default function ({ loaderData }: PageProps<typeof loader>) {
  return <UserProfile user={loaderData} />;
}
```

## Get Started

If you want to dive right in, just open a terminal and run `npx create-hwy@latest` and follow the prompts.

## Acknowledgements

Hwy's APIs are obviously inspired by Remix. If Remix didn't exist, Hwy likely wouldn't exist either. Hwy doesn't use any Remix code, but it still owes a big thanks to the Remix team (past and present) for their top-tier patterns design. If you're building something huge and important today, use Remix.

Hwy is in beta! Act accordingly.
